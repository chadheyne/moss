Assorted Scientific Utilities
=============================

Moss is a hodgepodge of functions, classes, and scripts to that may be useful
for analyzing scientific data. Because this package is developed for
neuroimaging and cognitive science, there is probably some bias towards
applications that are useful in that domain. However, the functions are
intended to be written in as general and lightweight a fashion as possible.

$ python setup.py install

Dependencies
------------
